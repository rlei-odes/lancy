## [Lancy v0.2.36] — 2026-05-01 · rlei-odes

### Added — Mode 2 authentication: admin/user role separation

Implements the Mode 2 auth foundation described in `docs/DESIGN_DOC_Admin_Role_Separation.md`. The system now supports two distinct roles (admin / user) with separate passwords, using HMAC-SHA256 signed session tokens that work in both the Next.js Edge Runtime (middleware) and Node.js API routes.

**Auth infrastructure:**
- `frontend/src/lib/auth.ts` — HMAC-SHA256 sign/verify utilities using the Web Crypto API; token format `role.exp_unix.hex_sig`
- `frontend/src/lib/auth-config.ts` — reads/writes `frontend/auth_config.json` (gitignored); falls back to `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var; exposes `isMode2Active()`, `getAdminPassword()`, `setAdminPassword()`
- `frontend/src/pages/api/auth/me.ts` — `GET /api/auth/me` returns `{ role }` for the current session
- `frontend/src/pages/api/auth/admin-config.ts` — `GET` returns current mode; `POST` sets or clears the admin password (admin-only, validates min 8 chars and must differ from `APP_PASSWORD`)

**Middleware:**
- Extracted `getRole()` as the architectural seam for future auth providers
- Mode 1 (no `APP_PASSWORD` set): open dev mode, all requests get role "admin"
- Mode 1 (APP_PASSWORD set): single password → role "admin"
- Mode 2 (`APP_PASSWORD` + `ADMIN_PASSWORD` both set): `APP_PASSWORD` → "user", `ADMIN_PASSWORD` → "admin"
- Bearer token and signed cookie both supported

**Login flow:**
- Login API now checks both passwords and issues a signed token with the appropriate role
- `useRole()` hook (`frontend/src/hooks/useRole.ts`) fetches `/api/auth/me` on mount

**Settings UI:**
- New "Role Separation" section in the sidebar settings panel
- Mode 1: "Set admin password…" button → dialog to activate Mode 2
- Mode 2 + role=user: status info + "Admin Login" button (navigates to `/login?redirect=...`)
- Mode 2 + role=admin: confirms admin session is active

**`API_KEY` → `APP_PASSWORD` rename:**
- Renamed in `frontend/.env`, `frontend/.env.example`, and all middleware/auth code
- `API_KEY` is freed for future use as a bearer token for backend API protection

**Docs:**
- `docs/DESIGN_DOC_Admin_Role_Separation.md`: appended Mode 1→2 transition flow and auth architecture sections
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: added full authentication section covering signed token scheme and the three planned modes

### Fixed — BackendStatus on login page showing as "down"

- `BackendStatus` is no longer rendered on the `/login` route (was polling unauthenticated and interpreting 401 as a network failure)
- HTTP 401 from the middleware is now treated as "reachable" (the proxy is up and responding)
- All three backend-status strings (`backendDown`, `backendDownSince`, `backendRecovered`) are now i18n-translated across all four languages (en/de/fr/it)

### Added — Proxy-level enforcement of admin-only API endpoints

Admin-only routes in the Next.js middleware now return 403 for user-role sessions: `POST /kb` (create), `PUT/DELETE /kb/*`, `POST /kb/{id}/documents` (upload), `POST /rag/reindex`, `POST /rag/reindex/cancel`. UI restrictions are now backed by real enforcement — the backend port (8080) remains unprotected and should be firewalled in production.

System prompt textarea is read-only for users (pill-styled); follow-up count remains editable.

`docs/API_Endpoints.md` updated with a two-layer architecture note, Bearer token auth instructions, and per-endpoint admin markers.

### Added — Role-based read-only UI in RAG config panel

- LLM and Embedding sections are fully read-only for users (pill-styled disabled controls via `fieldset disabled`)
- API key field shows a masked `••••••••` pill for users instead of the password input
- KB CRUD buttons (create/edit/delete) and reindex buttons disabled for users
- KB config preset toolbar disabled for users
- Only the Retrieval section is expanded by default; Prompt, LLM, and Embedding start collapsed

### Fixed — UI language on first visit

- Detection order set to `["localStorage", "navigator"]`: explicit user preference takes priority; browser locale is used on first visit if it matches a supported language (en/de/fr/it); otherwise falls back to English
- Previously, hardcoded strings in `BackendStatus` caused a jarring language mismatch when the browser locale was German — resolved by fully translating those strings (see above)

## [Lancy v0.2.35] — 2026-04-30 · rlei-odes

### Improved — RAG Parameters panel: preset split and modified-state indicator

Groundwork for admin/user role separation (see `docs/DESIGN_DOC_Admin_Role_Separation.md`). The previously flat preset system has been split into two independent preset types reflecting the underlying config separation:

- **Retrieval presets** snapshot `SessionConfig` (top-k, BM25, HyDE, reranking, LLM, prompt) — no re-index required
- **KB presets** snapshot `KBConfig` (embedding backend/model, file limits, OCR, chunking) — re-index required after applying

Each type has its own dropdown in the preset toolbar, styled with a blue `SlidersHorizontal` header and muted subtitle labels. Save, overwrite (by name), and delete work independently per type.

**Modified-state signal:** editing any field now clears the corresponding dropdown to show `— modified · unsaved —`, making divergence from the last loaded preset immediately visible. The placeholder is hidden from the open dropdown list so only named presets appear as selectable options.

**Other panel changes:**
- Per-section dirty-state dots (green = instant effect, amber = re-index required) computed against last-applied server state via `useRef` snapshots — removed the previous static green dots
- `saveAll` split into `applySessionConfig` + `applyKbConfig` with independent saved-state refs
- "Unsaved changes" notice moved above the Apply button (was incorrectly positioned below the preset toolbar)
- Backend `GET/POST /presets/{kb_id}` changed from flat list to `{ retrieval: [], kb: [] }` dict; old flat-list files are read back transparently

---

## [Lancy v0.2.34] — 2026-04-27 · rlei-odes

### Added — Image captioning pipeline

At ingest time, the main LLM can now generate a text caption for each extracted image and store it inline in the document chunk, replacing the `<!-- image -->` placeholder with a structured `<!-- image content -->` block containing extracted visible text and a visual description. This makes image content searchable via standard text retrieval (BM25, semantic, RRF) without requiring a separate VL embedding model or image vector store at query time.

- New `image_captioning_enabled` toggle on each KB (KB-level, re-index required)
- Captioning runs between file loading and embedding as a distinct `captioning` phase; the main LLM is reused — no additional model is loaded
- Images without a matching text placeholder are stored as standalone caption chunks
- Progress displayed in the indexing status bar as `2/3 Captioning images… x/y images`
- Phase labels updated from `1/2 / 2/2` to `1/3 / 2/3 / 3/3` to account for the new phase
- Compatible with `image_indexing_enabled` — both can be active simultaneously
- Requires a multimodal main LLM (e.g. `llava`, `qwen2-vl`, `gemma3` via Ollama); fails loudly if the model rejects an image payload
- Design doc: `docs/DESIGN_DOC_Image_Captioning.md`

### Added — Retrieval stats in chat

Each assistant message now shows retrieval counts in the same monospace footer as model/duration/tok-s. Without reranking: number of chunks passed to the LLM. With reranking: candidate pool size, final count, and how many the reranker swapped into the top-k (`15 → 5 chunks · 2 swaps`). Stats are persisted in message metadata and survive conversation reload.

### Improved — Image captioning efficiency

- Images below 100,000 px² are skipped before any LLM call (threshold calibrated on real document sets: 68k px² logo → exclude, 145k px² diagram → keep)
- Identical images within a file are captioned once; the result is reused for all occurrences
- `scripts/inspect_images.py` dev helper for analysing image dimensions across PDF files

### Fixed — Preset load dropped `llm_max_tokens` from session state

Loading a saved preset silently omitted `llm_max_tokens` from the `setSession` call, causing a TypeScript error and resetting the field to the state default rather than the preset value.

---

## [Lancy v0.2.33] — 2026-04-26 · rlei-odes

### Added — `max_tokens` cap for vLLM / custom LLM backend

Exposes a configurable output token limit for the `custom` and `litellm` backends (vLLM, Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible endpoints). Prevents runaway generation when the model fails to produce a clean EOS token.

- New `llm_max_tokens` field in `RagConfig` (default: 6144, range: 128–32768)
- Passed as `max_tokens` in every `create()` call inside `OpenAILLM` and `LocalLLM`; Ollama uses `num_predict` separately and is unaffected
- UI slider added to the LLM section of the RAG parameters panel (visible for `custom` and `litellm` backends only)

### Fixed — Follow-up questions slider had no effect at zero

Setting follow-up count to 0 still produced three suggested questions. The `follow_up_count` config value was stored but never enforced — the model always generated three from training bias.

- `CustomRAG` now takes `follow_up_count` as a constructor argument
- `_answer_post_processing` slices the model output to `[:self.follow_up_count]`, so 0 always returns an empty list regardless of what the model generates

### Fixed — Source list appeared slow after streaming

After the LLM finished streaming, sources were delayed because `onEnd` in `useMessaging.tsx` waited for a full `GET /api/v1/conversations/{id}` round-trip before calling `setThread`. Sources already arrive in the final stream chunk, so this GET was redundant for display. Removed `setThread` from the existing-conversation `onEnd` path; the GET still runs to keep `setMessages` in sync.

### Added — Timestamps in backend and frontend logs

- Backend: custom `log_config` passed to `uvicorn.run()` — access and error log lines now include millisecond timestamps matching the loguru format (`2026-04-26 13:00:33.149`)
- Frontend: `start.sh` pipes `npm run dev` through `awk` to prepend second-level timestamps on every log line

### Added — Granular RAG query status phases

The loading indicator now progresses through up to four named phases instead of two: `preprocessing` (query rewriting / expansion / HyDE, when active), `retrieving`, `reranking` (when enabled), and `generating`. Implemented via an optional `phase_callback` passed through `RAG.answer_stream()` and `RerankingRetriever`.

### Improved — `upload-docs.sh` batch upload script

- Reachability check before starting; clear error if backend is unreachable
- Upload-then-wait ordering so results appear immediately rather than after silent pre-upload pause
- Dot progress during indexing wait, with configurable timeout and connection-loss detection
- Relative paths shown for files in subdirectories
- Recursive scan up to 5 levels deep (was top-level only)

### Fixed — Indexing status showed temp filename during upload ingestion

The live indexing modal showed the backend temp file name (`tmpXXXX.pdf`) instead of the original document name. `current_file` in `_index_status` now reads from `source_file` in the upload metadata.

### Fixed — LLM error message was Ollama-specific

"Cannot reach Ollama. Is it running? Run: ollama serve" replaced with the backend-neutral "Cannot reach the LLM. Is it running?"

---

## [Lancy v0.2.32] — 2026-04-26 · rlei-odes

### Refactored — Extract ingestion pipeline to `ingestion.py`

Moved the ingestion pipeline out of `main.py` into a new `backend/src/lancy/ingestion.py` module. No behaviour change.

- `run_ingestion(kb, reset, db_dir)`, `ingest_uploaded_file(...)`, `cancel_indexing()`, `_index_status`, and `_cancel_requested` now live in `ingestion.py`
- `main.py` shrunk from 1260 to 822 lines; `ingestion.py` is 470 lines
- `ingest_uploaded_file` promoted from a closure to a proper function; `vs_proxy`, `kb_router`, and `db_dir` are now explicit parameters instead of captured variables
- Orphaned imports (`Counter`, `VS_PATH`, `file_hash`, `load_chunks`, `build_vector_store`, `_collect_candidate_files`) removed from `main.py`

### Fixed

- Cancelling an in-progress ingestion caused a `ValueError: not enough values to unpack` — `run_ingestion` returned a 3-tuple on cancellation but callers unpack 4 values; fixed to `return 0, 0, 0, 0`

---

### Added — Document Upload API

New endpoint for pushing documents into a KB over HTTP without requiring shared filesystem access. Designed as the ingestion path for remote deployments (e.g. DGX Spark) and as a webhook target for DMS automation pipelines.

- `POST /api/v1/kb/{id}/documents` — accepts multipart file + JSON metadata, ingests the document into the target KB via the existing ingestion pipeline, then discards the temp file
- `document_id` (required) enables versioning: re-uploading the same `document_id` deletes existing chunks before inserting new ones
- `source_file` defaults to the uploaded filename so citations show the real name rather than the temp path
- Full DMS metadata schema supported: `title`, `author`, `document_class`, `document_type`, `document_created_at`, `document_released_at`, `source_url`, `tags` — all fields are optional and stored verbatim on every chunk
- KB analytics sidecar (`kb_stats_{kb_id}.json`) is now updated after upload ingestion, keeping the Analytics tab in sync with incrementally uploaded documents
- `VectorStore.delete_chunks_by_document_id()` abstract method added; implemented for both ChromaDB and pgvector backends

### Added — Spark deployment scripts

Scripts for deploying the backend on a DGX Spark (or any Ubuntu/ARM machine):

- `scripts/spark-install.sh` — one-time setup: system packages, venv, pip install
- `scripts/start-backend.sh` — start backend-only in the background (no frontend, no Ollama check); prints LAN IP on start
- `scripts/stop-backend.sh` — stop via PID file, fall back to port kill

### Added — API documentation

- `docs/API_Endpoints.md` — full endpoint reference covering all KB, RAG, file serving, and OpenAI-compatible endpoints with request/response schemas

### Fixed

- Sidebar chunk count showed 0 / "not yet indexed" after incremental reindex — `update_stats` was using the delta count instead of the actual vector store total
- `source_file` in uploaded document chunks was set to the temp filename; now defaults to the original uploaded filename

---

## [Lancy v0.2.31] — 2026-04-22 · rlei-odes

### Added — Retrieval Explorer

Interactive explorer panel for inspecting what the retrieval pipeline actually returns before the LLM sees it. See `DESIGN_DOC_Retrieval_Explorer.md` for the full design record.

- `POST /api/v1/rag/retrieve` backend endpoint — runs the full retrieval pipeline (BM25, semantic, RRF, HyDE, query expansion, reranking) against a query without invoking the LLM; returns ranked chunks with scores and metadata
- Retrieval Explorer panel in the frontend — accessible from the sidebar; shows the probe results as a ranked chunk list with score, source file, page, and chunk text
- Results update live on query submit; panel state is independent of chat sessions

### Changed — Multilingual prompt improvements

- **System prompt** — replaced the hardcoded German-only prompt with a universal English prompt that instructs the LLM to detect the user's language and respond accordingly; supports cross-lingual retrieval (query in one language, documents in another)
- **Query expansion** — removed the forced English-only output; now generates queries in both the original query language and English for broader retrieval coverage across multilingual corpora
- **Query reformulation and HyDE** — added explicit language constraints so standalone query rewriting and hypothetical document generation stay in the user's language rather than defaulting to English

### Added — Chunk Browser (Retrieval Explorer v2)

Second tab on the `/explorer` page for browsing the raw vector store contents without running a query. See `DESIGN_DOC_Retrieval_Explorer.md` section 8 for the full design record.

- `POST /api/v1/rag/chunks` backend endpoint — server-side paginated fetch over indexed chunks; accepts a list of `{key, op, value}` filter conditions (ANDed); `limit+1` trick drives `has_more` without a total count query
- `ChunkBrowser` frontend component — file dropdown (populated from `store-info` on tab switch), add-filter rows with metadata key suggestions, TanStack Table v8 with fixed baseline columns (`#`, File, Title, Index, Type) plus dynamic columns derived from the result metadata; click-to-expand rows show full chunk text in a scrollable monospace pane; load-more pagination
- Tab switcher added to the Explorer page (Retrieval Probe / Chunk Browser)
- `get_chunks_by_filter` in both vector store backends updated to accept neutral `{field: value}` filter dicts (translated to ChromaDB `$eq`/`$and` internally) and `limit`/`offset` for true server-side pagination — previously the method loaded the full collection
- `ContextWindowRetriever` fixed to use the neutral filter format; it was passing ChromaDB-native `$and`/`$eq` syntax directly, which would have silently failed against the pgvector backend



### Added — KB Analytics (Retrieval Explorer v3)

Third tab on the `/explorer` page showing health and indexing statistics for any Knowledge Base without querying the vector store at runtime. See `DESIGN_DOC_KB_Analytics.md` for the full design record.

- Stats sidecar `db/kb_stats_{kb_id}.json` written at the end of every ingestion run — zero cost on page load; survives server restarts
- Full recompute on reset runs; incremental merge on partial runs (new hash entries inserted, bucket counts added, `chunks_per_document_distribution` recomputed, history entry appended)
- `chunk_chars` metadata field stamped on every chunk in `load_chunks()` (shared prerequisite with the planned chunk-length filter)
- `GET /api/v1/kb/{kb_id}/stats` endpoint — reads sidecar, 404 if KB has not been indexed yet
- `KbAnalytics` frontend component — KB selector (defaults to active KB), four panels:
  - **Summary strip** — total chunks, total documents, avg / P50 (median) / P95 chunk size
  - **Chunk size distribution** — bar chart in 200-char buckets (0–200 … 2000+)
  - **Chunks per document distribution** — 101-bar histogram (1–100 individual bars + 100+), scaled to any KB size
  - **Ingestion history** — stacked bar chart grouped by calendar day; incremental runs and reset runs shown as separate colour segments
- Recharts installed; CSS variables resolved via `getComputedStyle` so charts respond to light/dark mode
- All four UI languages updated (en, de, fr, it)

### Fixed

- `vs_path` in the default KB registry corrected to point within the project directory; previously pointed to a stale absolute path from the predecessor project


---

## [Lancy v0.2.30] — 2026-04-19 · rlei-odes

### Added — Multimodal Image Retrieval Pipeline

Dual-collection RAG pipeline for indexing and retrieving images from PDFs and standalone image files. See `DESIGN_DOC_IMAGE_RETRIEVAL.md` for the full design record.

- Two independent KB-level toggles: `image_indexing_enabled` (extract and embed images at ingest) and `image_retrieval_enabled` (query `vs_image` and inject into LLM context). Both default to `false` — zero overhead when disabled.
- Image chunks embedded with `Qwen3VL-Embedding-2B` into a separate ChromaDB collection at `<vs_path>_images`. Text pipeline unchanged.
- Session-level `image_retriever_top_k` (1–4, default 1) shown in the sidebar only when the active KB has `image_retrieval_enabled` on.
- `image_embedding_model` configurable per KB; shared by both indexing and retrieval.
- `write_images` parameter threaded through `_collect_candidate_files` and `load_chunks` — standalone image files enter the dedup pre-pass and are loaded as base64 chunks when enabled.
- `build_vector_store` generalised: text-only filter removed so image chunks are embedded correctly; caller routes text and image chunks to the appropriate store.
- Retrieval parallelised with `asyncio.gather` across all retrievers (replaces sequential loop); image retriever bypasses LLM reranking.
- KB deletion cleans up both `vs_text` and `vs_image` directories.
- All four UI languages updated (en, de, fr, it).

### Fixed — `stop.sh` Leaves Frontend Workers Running

Next.js spawns child worker processes not covered by the PID file. After `./stop.sh` these lingered, holding port 3000 so the next `./start.sh` would open on port 3001. Added `pkill -P <frontend_pid>` to kill child processes before the main process.

---

## [Lancy v0.2.29] — 2026-04-18 · rlei-odes

### Fixed — Answer Disappears After Streaming

`mistral-nemo:12b` emits literal newlines inside JSON string values, which is invalid JSON. `partial_json_loads` returned `{}`, the `"answer"` key was missing, and the DB record was saved as empty — causing the streamed answer to vanish when the frontend refreshed from the DB.

- `_escape_literal_newlines()` added to `utils/json.py` — walks the JSON character-by-character and escapes bare `\n`/`\r` inside string values before parsing
- `parse_llm_json_stream` now catches all exceptions from `partial_json_loads`, not only `ValueError`
- `_answer_post_processing` in `main.py` falls back to the raw accumulated text when the `"answer"` key cannot be extracted, preventing silent data loss

### Fixed — CORS Errors from Footer and SendBar

`footer.tsx` and `send-bar.tsx` used `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL || "http://localhost:8080"` as API base, causing direct browser requests instead of routing through the Next.js proxy. Changed to `typeof window !== "undefined" ? "" : (process.env.SERVER_URL ?? "")`, matching the pattern used by all other components.

### Fixed — Duplicate React Key in Suggestions

`Suggestions` component keyed suggestion cards by `suggestion.text`, which caused a React warning and potential rendering issues when two suggestions shared the same text (e.g. both using `"Summarise:"`). Changed to index-based keys.

### Improved — Reindex Success Toast

- Skip counts split into `files_skipped_store` (already in vector store) and `files_skipped_batch` (duplicate content within the same run); toast shows them separately when both are non-zero
- Completion timestamp appended to the toast (e.g. "· 14:32")

### Added — Re-index Confirmation Dialog

The Re-index ↺ button (reset=True) now shows an inline confirmation dialog before proceeding. When the store is non-empty, the dialog displays the current chunk and file count ("This will permanently delete N chunks from M files…"). All four UI languages supported.

---

## [Lancy v0.2.29] — 2026-04-16 · rlei-odes

### Fixed — Markdown and Plain-Text Ingestion

`MarkdownChunker._pdf2markdown` was missing `**kwargs`, causing all `.md` and `.txt` files to fail with `unexpected keyword argument 'do_ocr'` and produce 0 chunks. Added `**kwargs` to absorb PDF-specific parameters passed by the parent `make_chunks`.

### Fixed — Reindex Proxy Timeout

`POST /reindex` previously held the HTTP connection open until ingestion completed. The Next.js Flatpak proxy would time out on large KBs, returning a 500 to the frontend while the job continued silently in the backend.

- `POST /reindex` now returns `{"started": true}` immediately; the job runs as a FastAPI background task
- `last_result` added to `IndexStatus` and populated by `rebuild_callback` on completion
- Frontend polling loop extended with `prevFinishedAt` detection (same pattern as the indexing progress modal) to show the success toast and refresh the KB registry when the job finishes

---

## [Lancy v0.2.28] — 2026-04-14 · rlei-odes

### Added — Ingestion Deduplication

Content-hash based deduplication prevents redundant parsing and embedding when the same
file is encountered more than once, either across runs or within a single batch.

- `file_hash()` — SHA-256 fingerprint of raw file bytes; content-based, filename-agnostic
- `_collect_candidate_files()` — shared helper for file discovery (extension, size, EVALUATION filter), used by both the dedup pre-pass and `load_chunks`
- Pre-pass in `_run_ingestion`: hashes all candidate files in an executor before parsing; applies cross-run dedup (skip if hash already in store) and within-batch dedup (skip duplicate content in the same run); only files that pass both checks reach `load_chunks`
- `load_chunks` gains `include_files` and `file_hashes` params; stamps every chunk with `chunk.metadata["file_hash"]` for future lookups; falls back to on-the-fly hashing when called standalone (notebook compatible)
- `build_vector_store` removes the all-or-nothing `current_count > 0` guard (which silently skipped new files on incremental runs); groups chunks by `file_hash`, skips groups already in the store; accepts `existing_hashes` from caller to avoid a second full metadata scan
- `VectorStore.get_file_hashes()` — new abstract method; implemented in `ChromaDBVectorStore` (metadata-only scan via `run_in_executor`) and `PGVectorStore` (DISTINCT SQL on `chunk_metadata["file_hash"]`)
- `ReindexResult` gains `files_skipped` field; success toast in all four UI languages shows skipped count when non-zero
- Warning logged when a store is non-empty but has no `file_hash` metadata (KB indexed before this feature; first incremental run re-embeds everything, subsequent runs are incremental)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: new Ingestion Pipeline chapter documenting the full flow, dedup layers, key functions, and threading model

---

## [Lancy v0.2.27] — 2026-04-13 · rlei-odes

### Added — Project Tooling
- `CLAUDE.md` — AI assistant briefing: project overview, key files, current config, development guidelines, security principles, commit convention, documentation drift rules
- `start.sh` / `stop.sh` rewritten — self-contained, path-independent, starts both backend and frontend in the background with PID tracking and log files in `logs/`
- `start.sh`: Ollama health check on startup; warns if Ollama is unreachable or configured model is not pulled (reads model name from `rag_config.json` dynamically)

### Added — Documentation
- `README.md`: Known Issues section added
- `CHANGELOG.md`: changelog reference added to `CLAUDE.md`

### Changed — Frontend
- Temperature hint updated in all four languages (DE/EN/FR/IT) to show `default: 0.2 (recommended for RAG)`
- `DEFAULT_SESSION.llm_temperature` aligned to `0.2` to match `rag_config.json`
- `frontend/package.json`: removed `open-browser` script and auto-launch from `dev` command (was hardcoded to wrong port 3001, opened browser before server was ready)

### Removed
- `SUMMARY.md` — redundant with `README.md`; Known Issues section preserved and moved to `README.md`

---

## [Lancy v0.2.26] — 2026-04-12 · rlei-odes

### Fixed — Merge Conflict Resolution
Resolved leftover upstream merge conflict markers across four files, keeping the fork's HEAD version in each case:
- `conversational-toolkit/src/conversational_toolkit/chunking/pdf_chunker.py` — guard `write_images` flag before creating image output directory
- `conversational-toolkit/src/conversational_toolkit/llms/local_llm.py` — lazy `MessageContent` import; use `raw_content` variable consistently
- `conversational-toolkit/src/conversational_toolkit/conversation_database/controller.py` — retain keepalive SSE streaming logic (`asyncio.wait` + timeout sentinel)
- `backend/src/lancy/utils/json.py` — retain pre-compiled `_CODE_FENCE_RE` regex and fork's JSON parse logic

### Fixed — Dependencies
- `requirements.txt`: added `einops` (required by `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1` via SentenceTransformers)

### Fixed — VectorStore Abstraction
- Added `get_source_files()` abstract method to `VectorStore` base class
- Implemented in `ChromaDBVectorStore` (metadata-only fetch via `run_in_executor`) and `PGVectorStore` (async `DISTINCT` SQL query)
- Removed two `isinstance(vs, ChromaDBVectorStore)` checks from `main.py` that bypassed the abstraction and left pgvector without a file list
- Extracted `_inject_source_files()` async helper — called from `rebuild_callback` and `_startup` so both backends get the indexed file list injected into the agent system prompt
- Removed `ChromaDBVectorStore` import from `main.py` — no longer needed

### Added — Prompt File Management
- System prompt extracted from hardcoded Python string into `prompts/system_prompt.default.md` — committed, ships as the baseline
- `prompts/system_prompt.custom.md` — gitignored; written automatically when user saves a custom prompt via the UI, never pushed to the repo
- Load priority: custom file → default file; clearing the prompt in the UI deletes the custom file and resets to default
- `rag_config.json` no longer stores `system_prompt` — prompt lives exclusively in the file system

### Fixed — Repository Hygiene
- `.gitignore`: added `.venv/` entry (was listed as `venv/` only, causing IDE source control noise on fresh installs)

---

- Dynamic Ollama model list fetched from local server at runtime

### Added — Chunking
- MarkItDown chunker (`markitdown_chunker.py`) — EPUB, DOCX, DOC support

### Added — OpenAI-Compatible Endpoint
- `POST /v1/chat/completions` — maps to active KB RAG query
- `GET /v1/models` — returns available KBs as model list
- Works with Open WebUI, curl, n8n, and any OpenAI-compatible client

### Added — Frontend (RAG Config Panel)
- Collapsible right-side RAG Parameters panel (`rag-config-panel.tsx`)
- Live parameter tuning: K, BM25, HyDE, Query Expansion, Reranking, temperature
- Presets: fast / balanced / quality
- Re-index button with live progress and cancel
- LLM model selector with dynamic Ollama list
- Embedding backend and model configuration

### Added — Frontend (Sidebar & Session Management)
- Config badges per conversation: KB · LLM · T= · emb: · k= · BM25 · Rerank · HyDE
- Session labels for A/B evaluation grouping
- Per-session delete
- Hover tooltip with full config snapshot

### Added — Frontend (Auth)
- Password-protected login page (`/login`)
- Session cookie authentication (`rag_auth`)
- Middleware protecting all routes
- `POST /api/auth/login` and `POST /api/auth/logout` handlers

### Added — Frontend (i18n)
- Internationalization: DE / EN / FR / IT
- Language auto-detection from browser
- All UI strings externalized to `frontend/src/lib/lang/`

### Added — Frontend (Generation Stats)
- Per-response footer: LLM model name · query duration · tokens/second

### Added — Deployment
- Systemd user service templates (`insight-backend.service`, `insight-frontend.service`)
- nginx reverse proxy configuration (`nginx.conf`)
- `.env.example` for frontend
- Multi-device proxy rewrite setup (SERVER_URL="" pattern)

### Fixed — Async Architecture
- Full `asyncio` + `run_in_executor` refactor throughout backend
- Fixes SSE/streaming blocking under concurrent load
- SentenceTransformer, ChromaDB, BM25 all non-blocking

### Fixed — Stream Sentinel
- `AttributeError` on response end in `controller.py` when stream sentinel was `None`
- Fixes frontend hanging on query completion in certain LLM backends

## [Upstream Baseline] — 2026-03 · SDSC

Notebook material reviewed and finalized by Paulina Koerner (SDSC):
- All feature notebooks (`feature0a` through `feature4e`) reviewed and corrected
- `feature4` utility file created
- mypy warnings resolved

Original baseline implemented by the Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC):
- 5-stage RAG pipeline: chunk → embed → store → retrieve → generate
- ChromaDB vector store
- SentenceTransformer embeddings
- Ollama and OpenAI LLM backends
- RAGAS evaluation framework integration
- Structured evidence outputs (VERIFIED / CLAIMED / MISSING / MIXED)
- BM25 + hybrid RRF retrieval (notebook implementation)
- HyDE and query expansion (notebook implementation)
- Agent and tool-use notebooks
- PrimePack AG scenario dataset with deliberate flaws
